# Ki4a Project

Ki4a lets you tunnel your android's traffic over SSH in a very easy way.

## Building the app

This version forks the original project to add android studio and gradle support. Building the project should be as easy as opening the project in Android Studio and making a release package.

## Google Play Store

There is currently no release package on Google Play Store, I am waiting on the original maintainer to give me permission.
